# Project Title

GMM EM Algorithem implementation

## Description

I Created a simple example for Bivariate GMM,which is an unsupervised learning algorithm,and a use case of EM algorithem.
It can be used for clustering of data.

## Getting Started
just run the file..

### Dependencies

i wrote it in pycharm enviorment,python 3.7.
so you may need to add some modules except for what i used-
sklearn,numpy,random and scipy


### Executing program
you can run the training part  in one piece, or run every function in separate.

## Help

common issue is that multivariate_normal.pdf  scipy function can get nan or inf values and than it breaks,
i generated for this an exception.if you are having trouble with that let me know.
